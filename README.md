# Imersão Dados Alura

## These exercises was my first experience with Phyton/Data Science and was made in the event week called "Imersão Dados", from Alura. In this week, it was done an analysis about the data from ENEM 2019

### The analysis was developed in Phyton, with the libraries Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The platform used in the project was Jupyter Notebook.
